// settings.ini [network] steam_relay (default 0).

// settings.ini [display] fonts (default 1): the Russian game gets the mod's fonts (fonts.c); 0 keeps the game's own.
int settings_fonts(void);
// settings.ini [display] fontmip (default 1): the mod's font atlas is filtered between its mip levels (trilinear), so small text is smooth; 0 keeps the game's plain bilinear.
int settings_fontmip(void);
// settings.ini [display] darktitle (default 1): the game window gets the dark title bar and square corners of Windows 10/11 (window.c); 0 leaves it as the game makes it.
int settings_darktitle(void);
// settings.ini [display] hwgamma (default 1): the game sets the display's hardware gamma ramp from r_gamma (default 0.8, a darker picture than the windowed and borderless modes, which have no ramp) in exclusive full screen; 0 sets r_ignorehwgamma so that full screen looks like them (guards.c).

// settings.ini [native] unlinkguard (default 1): the iw4x-sp client only, see guards.c.

// settings.ini [display] d3d9ex (default 0 until tested, then 1): the game's Direct3D 9 is the extended one (Direct3DCreate9Ex, src/d3dcap.c): a window that loses the focus (Alt+Tab) does not lose the device,
// so the render thread does not stop and a co-op partner is not left waiting. Not in the iw4x-sp profile (it has its own r_useD3D9Ex).

// matching blocks only), 2 = the classic correction (every block; guesses motion from the jitter's aliasing on distant fine detail).

// settings.ini [display] upscale (default 0): the game renders at the size of its own video settings and is upscaled to upscale_width x upscale_height (FSR 1, upscale.c);
