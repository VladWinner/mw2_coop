// Finding the game's addresses by byte signatures, for a build of iw4sp.exe the mod was not written against (docs/address-resolution.md).
//
// The signature file (mw2coop\addresses-x86.txt / addresses-x64.txt, made by tools/addrsig.py from the reference build) lists, for each address
// the mod uses (an RVA of the reference build), byte patterns of the code around it. addr_resolve() searches the running build's code for them;
// an address is accepted only when two signatures agree (or one long code signature does), or, for a global that no signature found, when the
// nearest resolved globals on both sides moved by the same amount. What is not accepted stays unresolved; the mod must not use it.
