// mw2coop: the Cliffhanger ice climb and big jump for two players (maps\_climb, a common script).
// Called from mw2coop/patches/maps/_climb.gsc.patch, _climb_anim.gsc.patch and
// cliffhanger.gsc.patch. Outside a co-op campaign session every entry point does what the
// original code did.
//
// The level starts maps\_climb::climb_wall for every player at its own "player_climb" start
// (the map has two lanes), but the climb code works on level.player and on level flags. The
// patches turn it per player:
//  - level.player -> the climbing player in every function of the climb (patch `subst`s);
//  - the climb's flags (trigger volumes and the climb's own state) become per-player entity
//    flags here, fed by the same trigger volumes (pflag*, flag_monitor);
//  - the swing buttons are read from the player's usercmd (attack/ads), not from local keys,
//    so both lockstep machines see the same input;
//  - player 2 climbs his own lane; the shared spots at the top (pull-up, big jump, final
//    climb, getting up) are moved over by the distance between the two lanes (lane_*);
//  - big jump: Soap catches the players in turn (catch_queued).
