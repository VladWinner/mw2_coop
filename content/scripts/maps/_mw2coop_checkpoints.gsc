// mw2coop: checkpoints for the levels that run their sections themselves (Wolverines!: start_bmp
// threads handler_house_destroyer_to_pizza, which the section before calls when it ends). A start
// point is reached when a flag of the level is set: the last flag that start point's start
// function sets and the one before it does not, i.e. the end of the section before it, set in a
// normal run by a script or a map trigger. Found with tools/find_section_handlers.py and checked
// by hand; developers' test starts, generic helpers and flags that may come early are left out.
// Levels whose sections are add_start() section functions need no table (maps\_load patch), and
// the start points marked only by a section handler are hooked by tools/gen_checkpoint_patches.py.
// Each flag reached calls maps\_mw2coop::section_reached, which only moves forward.
// Audit of 2026-11-08 (issue #16 and the Arcadia report in issue #9): the rule "the flag the start function sets" picked flags that are set long
// before the start point's place (Arcadia's used_laser at the first laser use, disable_stryker_dialog right after the checkpoint), and some
// sections begin before the players get there (late_sections). Every pair below was checked against the map data (where the flag's trigger is
// against the place the start point puts the players: a restart may put them a little back, never ahead) and, where a real session's log had
// it, against where both players were when the checkpoint was taken.
