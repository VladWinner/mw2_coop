// mw2coop: the Endgame boat chase (af_chase) for two players. Called from the patches of
// maps/af_chase_code.gsc and maps/af_chase_waterfall.gsc (tools/gen_boat_patches.py). Those
// scripts are byte-identical in the af_chase and ending zones, so this file names only them and
// the common scripts. Outside a co-op campaign session every entry point does what the original
// code did.
//
// Owner's design (2026-10-21): whoever mounts the boat first drives it (the level's player,
// level.mw2coop_lead, every level.player of the chase); the other player rides in the boat as a
// gunner with his own weapons and normal damage. Nobody can revive anyone in the boat, so a
// player going down there is the single player death: the boat flips and the mission fails.
